Automation project for utilizing GPT API

## Usage Instructions

Note: Still WIP

1. Copy User Data from your local machine (avoids captcha issues):
    - How to copy user data for windows users 
        - Navigate to C:/Users/{your username}/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data
        - Copy this folder User Data into the program directory replacing the current User Data folder

        - Alternative is to click windows key
        - Type in %appdata%
        - Navigate back one directory then go to Local/Google/Chrome/User Data
        - Copy this folder User Data into the program directory replacing the current User Data folder

2. Setup an OpenAI api key:
    - Go to https://platform.openai.com/
    - Login with an account or create a new account
    - Once you log in click on the top left icon for your profile
    - Click "Create project"
    - Give the project a name
    - Since we use the GPT 4o "Vision" API you will need to add at least 5 dollars to make requests
    - In the usage window you will see "Increase limit", click on this
    - On the next page under "settings" click on billing and here you can "Add credit balance"
    - Once you do this we can create an API key
    - Hover to the left side of the page to open the side nav
    - From there select "API keys"
    - Go ahead and create a new key and you should be set to go!
